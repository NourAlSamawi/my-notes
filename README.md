what  I learned from lecture? 
CLI vs GUI: Command Line Interface (CLI) allows text-based interaction, efficient for experienced users, while Graphical User Interface (GUI) provides a visual and intuitive experience, ideal for beginners or those preferring a graphical environment.

VCS and Git: Version Control Systems (VCS) track changes in code, enhancing collaboration. Git, a distributed VCS, excels in branching, merging, and decentralized workflows, fostering effective team collaboration in software development.

GitHub and Markdown Language: GitHub, a web-based platform, hosts Git repositories, facilitating collaborative coding. Markdown language simplifies formatting on platforms like GitHub, enabling users to create well-structured and readable documentation with ease.
